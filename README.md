## Overview
this is a simple projects demonstrating the life cycle of an data science project i have learned.

## Motivation
After learning aspects of ML/DL, i want to apply what have i learned to specific project to reenforce my knowledge in ML/DL.

## Data Science Life Cycle
A project can be devided into 5 parts:
1. Data analysis
2. Feature engineering
3. Feature selection
4. Model building
5. Model deployment
